                    For my final assessment in high school, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the BERT
                    Project, a prestigious competition between schools that presents students with a unique problem to
                    solve each year. The challenge for our year was to detect graffiti on trains and develop an
                    efficient method to remove it. <br> <br>

                    Together with another student, we approached the problem with innovative solutions. In collaboration
                    with FLIR, we developed a camera equipped with AI capabilities to detect graffiti accurately. This
                    advanced technology allowed for real-time identification of graffiti on train surfaces. <br> <br>

                    To address the removal process, we designed a lifting hoist that could be easily attached to the
                    trains using suction cups. This mechanism ensured that the cleaning equipment could be securely and
                    swiftly positioned. <br> <br>

                    Moreover, in partnership with BASF, we formulated an environmentally friendly product specifically
                    designed to remove graffiti. This solution was not only effective in cleaning but also aligned with
                    sustainability principles. <br> <br>

                    Our project culminated in a presentation attended by approximately 100 people, including political
                    figures and industry experts. The positive reception and interest from the audience were
                    overwhelming. Ultimately, our hard work and innovative approach earned us the public prize, a
                    testament to the effectiveness and creativity of our solutions. <br> <br>

                    Winning the public prize at the BERT Project competition was a proud moment for us. It demonstrated
                    the power of collaboration, innovation, and dedication in tackling real-world problems. This
                    experience has been a significant highlight of my high school journey, providing valuable lessons
                    and inspiration for future endeavors. <br> <br>

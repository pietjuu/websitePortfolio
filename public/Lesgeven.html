                <h3>Teaching Cybersecurity: A Lesson for High School Students</h3>
                <div class="imageFlex">
                    <p>
                        A while ago, I had the opportunity to teach a lesson on cybersecurity to high school students.
                        The goal was to share my knowledge and raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and
                        how easily systems can be exploited if not properly secured.

                        During the lesson, I covered several key topics. First, I explained basic cybersecurity concepts
                        and the various types of vulnerabilities that can exist in software and hardware. I emphasized
                        how even seemingly small weaknesses can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized
                        access to systems and data.

                        To make the lesson more engaging, I highlighted how much information can be found online, often
                        more than people realize. This part of the lesson aimed to make the students aware of their
                        digital footprint and the importance of protecting their personal information.

                        The highlight of the session was a live demonstration of the EternalBlue vulnerability.
                        EternalBlue is a well-known exploit that takes advantage of a flaw in the SMB protocol on
                        Windows operating systems. I walked the students through how the exploit works and demonstrated
                        its potential impact by showing how it could be used to gain control of a vulnerable system.
                        This demo was a powerful way to illustrate the real-world implications of cybersecurity threats.

                        The students were highly engaged throughout the lesson, asking insightful questions and
                        expressing a keen interest in learning more about how to protect themselves and their systems
                        from cyber threats. By the end of the session, they had a better understanding of the importance
                        of cybersecurity and the steps they could take to safeguard their digital lives.

                        <p>
                            The recent Python Conference 2024 brought together some of the brightest minds in the Python
                            community, covering a wide array of topics from the fundamentals of open-source
                            contributions to
                            the
                            intricacies of modern web frameworks. Here’s a recap of the key sessions and takeaways from
                            this

                    <h3> Keynote: You Can Do It by Daniel Stenberg </h3>
                    <div class="imageFlex">
                        <div>
                        <p>
                            Daniel Stenberg, the creator of Curl, kicked off the conference with an inspiring keynote.
                            Despite
                            not writing Python himself, Stenberg's insights on open source were invaluable:

                            The Journey of Curl: Stenberg shared how his code, written 27 years ago, now runs on
                            virtually
                            every
                            internet-connected device.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> - Open Source Philosophy: He emphasized starting small and being patient. Success in open
                                source requires accepting periods of solitary work. </li>
                            <li> - Security and Maintenance: Own your security problems, adapt, and continuously test.
                            Emphasize
                                readable code, documentation, and comprehensive testing to mitigate issues. </li>
                            <li> - The Future of Open Source: With 25 years in the open-source domain, Stenberg believes the
                            future holds even greater reliance on open-source solutions. </li>
                        </ul>

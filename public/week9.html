                <p>
                    This was one of the most relaxing weeks so far. We did not have any trips planned and we had a lot
                    of time to catch up on schoolwork. We did go to the gym a few times and had some nice dinners with
                    friends. During the week we watched a lot of movies. We also
                    did some schoolwork and prepared for the next week because then there are exams.

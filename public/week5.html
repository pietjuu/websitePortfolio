                    Today, September 18th, was a quiet day. I did a lengthy run of 15 km in
                    the serene mountains of Billingen. In the evening, a sudden idea struck me; I decided to sign
                    up for a marathon. Alongside this, I enjoyed some fun moments, engaging in cart games with my
                    friends, and dedicated some time to studying.

                    This day was also very quiet. I spent most of the day studying and preparing for the upcoming exams.
                    In the evening, I decided to treat myself to a delicious meal. I made cannelloni, a dish I had
                    cooked before. It was a nice experience, and I enjoyed every bite.

                    After a rest day yesterday in the running, I went today on an 18km run. I actually saw a deer when I
                    was running. I also got a final interview for my internship at EFFIX Group. I am very excited to
                    start working there. In the evening we did a movienight with my friends from all the dorms. We
                    watched Doctor Strange. It was a very fun night.

                    Today was a big day, I packed my things because we would go for a long weekend to Stockholm. I left
                    quiet early with the German people and with Matthew, Adam and Mathis. When we arrived we had a long
                    walk to our hostel. Once settled down, we decided to plan the weekend. We wanted to make the most of
                    our Stockholm experience. Once everything was planned, we decided to explore the city and went for a
                    walk. We stumbled on an Irish pub, and we decided to go eat over there. After dinner, we went to an
                    ice bar. This is a bar, but everything is in ice. The glasses, the chairs, everything. It was a
                    really cool experience. When our time in the icebar was over, we went to the international bar and
                    decided to drink some more. It was a very fun night.

                    The day started early, and we headed of to the Vasa Museum. This museum is a museum that is built
                    around a ship that sunk in the 17th century. The ship was salvaged in the 20th century and is now in
                    the museum. It was a very interesting museum. After the museum, we went to Skansen it is an open-air
                    museum with a lot of animals. After that we went to an all-you-can-eat restaurant. We ate a lot of
                    food. In the evening we went to an ESN party. This is the biggest party for erasmus students in
                    Sweden. It was a very fun night.

                    Today was also a very busy day. We went to a lot of different museums. Starting with the paradox
                    museum. This museum is a museum about the human brain. It was fascinating. After that we went
                    to the shipwreck museum. This museum is about the shipwrecks in the Baltic sea. It was also very
                    cool. Then we went to an irish pub to watch the rugby game between Ireland and South africa. Luckily
                    for us, Ireland won. After that we went to a special place to watch he sunset.

                    This day is the last day of our time in stockholm. We decided to go to the old city. This is the
                    oldest part of Stockholm. It was very cool to see all the old buildings. We stumbled to the change
                    of the royal guard at the house of the king. This was very cool to see. Especially the army that
                    came and started to play dancing queen. The old city center has also some of the narrowest streets
                    in Stockholm and a lot of colorful houses After that we went to the railway station to go back to
                    Sk√∂vde. It was a thrilling weekend.

                <p>
                    Today, I set off on my journey from Zaventem, Belgium, and hopped on a flight to Munich, Germany,
                    before finally landing in Stockholm, Sweden. It was quite the adventure just getting here!
                    Upon my arrival in Stockholm, I encountered a problem – I missed my train at Stockholm Central
                    station. But after a quick call with the train company they gave me new tickets for a later train
                    that also went to Skövde. The difference was just that this was not a fast train so I was on the
                    train for more then 3 hours. I finally reached my dorm at around 5 PM. However, there was another
                    problem, my keycard was missing, so I had to wait for a bit. <br> <br>
                    While waiting, I had the opportunity to meet some of my dorm mates, who were mostly Germans and some
                    Mexicans.
                    To cap off the day, we decided to go out and enjoy the nightlife, which turned into a fun evening of
                    partying. It was a great way to kickstart this Erasmus adventure, but by the time we wrapped up the
                    party, it was 3 AM when I got back to my room. <br> <br>
                    So, my day began and ended at 3 AM, marking a
                    memorable start to this adventure. I'm looking forward to more exciting experiences in the days to
                    come.

                <p>
                    After a good night's sleep, I went to the common area to meet some of my fellow students. That's
                    where I met Vincent, a student from Darmstadt, Germany. While chatting, we found out we both liked
                    running. <br>
                    Vincent suggested we run together to Billingen and then to the university, so I could see
                    the city and learn the way to campus. Our run was great, Billingen is up on a mountain and very
                    beautiful. We even saw a deer while running. After that, we went back to our dorm to drink some
                    water and then visited the university. Vincent showed me around quickly. We ran 13 kilometers in
                    total that day. Tired but happy, I went back to my dorm to relax for a while. <br>
                    That wraps up day two and my first week here.

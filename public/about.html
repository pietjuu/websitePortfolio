                <p>Hi I am Pieter Verheye and I am 22 years old. I currently study Applied Informatics - Cyber Security
                    Professional at Howest Bruges.
                    I was born in Kortrijk and I currently live there as well, I also lived in Bruges as a student for 2
                    years and I lived a half year in Sweden Sk√∂vde because of an exchange.
                    In my free time I like to play with a basketball. I am therefore pretty active in that world.
                    Currently I play with Elektrooghe Gembas Knesselare in 2de provinciale. I also am an assistent coach
                    with the first team (2de landelijke).
                    As a headcoach I used to coach Avanti Dames Brugge where we won the championship with the U14 team
                    but currently I am not an headcoach af any team.
                    Furthermore I referee sometimes some basketbal games and I like to watch games as well.
                    That is a small introduction about me! If you want to know more than you can follow me on my social
                    media's!

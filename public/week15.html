                <p>
                    Today was a very exciting day because this week would be our long waited Lapland trip. We had to
                    wake up early and travel to the trainstation. There we stepped on the bus and we started our 25hour
                    roadtrip to Lapland. We had a lot of fun on the bus and we played some games. We also watched some
                    movies and we had a lot of fun. We also did some schoolwork and prepared for the next week.

                    Today we had some free time in lapland. We decided to go for a walk and discover the beautiful
                    nature.

                    Today we went on a snowshoe walk at night. This was very cool and the shoes are very strange. They
                    are very big and you have to walk very strange. It was fun because we needed to make our own path to
                    the top of the mountain. It was a great experience and we had a lot of fun.

                <p>
                    Today we went to the fjords of Norway. To get there we needed to travel 4 hours by bus. But it was
                    worthed. The view was insane, and the nature was beautiful. We decided to dive into the cold water
                    and then go into the sauna that was provided. It was a great experience and we had a lot of fun.

                    Today was the highlight of the week. We went on a husky ride. It was a great experience and we had a
                    lot of fun. Meeting the dogs and riding the sled was a great experience. We also had a lot of fun
                    with the dogs and we played some games with them. It was a great experience and we had a lot of fun.

                    Today was the last activity of the week. I went on a snowmobile ride. I was lucky because I was
                    alone on a snowmobile. I had a lot of fun and I had a great experience. I also saw the northern
                    lights. It was a great experience and I had a lot of fun.

                <p>
                    Today we woke up very early to head back to Skövde. On our way back we stopped in Rovaniemie to
                    visit the Santa Claus village. It was a great experience and we had a lot of fun. We also did some
                    shopping and we bought some souvenirs. After that we continued our journey back to Skövde. It was a
                    great experience and we had a lot of fun.

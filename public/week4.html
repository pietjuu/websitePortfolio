                    Today, September 11, 2023, we took a trip to the lake called Gamla Ovlen Badet Pratsbevtagen with
                    some friends. The usual crew was thereâ€”Maud, Kim, Niels, David, Matthew, Mathis, Adam, and myself.
                    This time, Adrian from Darmstadt, Germany, also joined us. <br> <br>

                    We packed the day with plenty of activities at the lake. We started with a hike around the scenic
                    area, followed by swimming and diving into the cool waters. We spent a good amount of time playing
                    beach volleyball and wrapped up our active day by fishing, relaxing by the water
                    as we waited for a catch. <br> <br>

                    After a day filled with fun we headed back home by bus. It was a great day!

                    Today we began planning our upcoming trip to Stockholm, which is scheduled for September 21st. We
                    focused on accommodations and transport options. Considering the train
                    journey can take about four hours, depending on which train we choose. <br> <br>

                    Although it was a relatively quiet day, none of us felt like cooking, so we decided to eat dinner at
                    an all-you-can-eat restaurant. It was a nice break from our daily routines and a chance to indulge a
                    bit. <br> <br>

                    The evening brought an exciting event: a big football match between Germany and France. With a
                    lot of German and French students in our dorm, the game was a major event here.
                    Germany clinched the win with a score of 2-1. After the game we went all to sleep!

                    Today marked the first instance of a "cultural clash" among the students, which proved to be quite
                    intense. Some of the Mexican students found themselves in disagreements with students of other
                    nationalities. These moments are often challenging but can serve as learning opportunities for
                    everyone involved to understand and appreciate diverse perspectives better. Other than that, it was
                    a relatively uneventful day without any other notable incidents.

                    Today was a quiet rest day, with everyone focusing on the university. We were all kept busy with
                    homework and other university tasks, taking the time to catch up on their studies
                    and prepare for upcoming classes and assignments.

                    Today was packed with lectures and assignments for university, keeping me busy from morning till
                    evening. Fortunately, after all the hard work, we had a chance to unwind and party at KB. For the
                    first time, there was plenty of tequila available, which meant that pretty much everyone ended up
                    quite drunk.

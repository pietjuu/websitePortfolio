                <p>
                    Today, August 28, 2023, marked my first official school day. Having missed the introduction week due
                    to exams back in Belgium, I had some catching up to do, starting with setting up my school account.
                    Interestingly, unlike in Belgium, the office package isn't provided here. The setup was trickier
                    than expected since everything was in Swedish, which we couldn't fully understand. However, this
                    challenge turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it helped me meet new people who were also
                    struggling with their accounts. <br> <br>

                    Once my account was set up, I joined some folks from Perenius, my dorm, and we headed to the student
                    kick-off. The event was a bit chaotic since we were choosing individual subjects instead of
                    enrolling in a complete course, which left us without a specific group. Despite this, we made the
                    most of it, playing games like Mario Kart on the Wii and Just Dance on campus. <br> <br>

                    Later, we returned to our dorm to get ready for a big party night at KB, a popular student hangout.
                    At the party, I met people from Xenia, another student dorm. I got to know Maud, Kim, and Niels from
                    the Netherlands, who quickly became good friends. I also met Noah and David from Germany and Malta,
                    respectively, and they too became close friends. That wraps up the day!

                    After a long sleep, recovering from a party that lasted until 3 AM, I woke up and decided to check
                    out the photos shared by my new friends. One of the pictures, taken by David, captured all the new
                    people I met at the party. Later, in the common area of our dorm, I met Mathis from Toulouse,
                    France, who quickly became a good friend. As we chatted, I learned that Mathis is a volleyball
                    player and enjoys sports and running just like me. With this common interest, we decided to go for a
                    long run in Billingen along with Vincent. We managed a 9 km run—a pretty good distance, in my
                    opinion. <br> <br>

                    During the run, we brainstormed some travel ideas within Scandinavia and discovered that there's a
                    Lapland journey organized by the Erasmus Student Network (ESN). Excited about this, we spread the
                    word back at our dorm and booked the trip to Lapland, although it's only scheduled for December.
                    More details about this adventure will be shared in that part of the blog!

                    Today kicked off with Aron and me catching some World Cup basketball action. Aron, who is from
                    Mexico, might just be a bigger basketball fan than I am. <br> <br>
                    With the academic year just starting,
                    there's no shortage of parties, so once again, we found ourselves out celebrating. It was during
                    this party that my closest circle of friends truly formed. Matthew and Adam from Ireland,
                    Mathis from France, and I bonded together. Later that party I figured out our group name “Party Woop
                    Woop.” This marked the beginning of what promises to be many memorable
                    times together. We partied until 3 AM before finally calling it a night.

                    Today marked my return to playing basketball after a long break. I joined Noah, David, and several
                    Spanish friends for a few hours of hoops on an outdoor court. As the game progressed, many from the
                    Xenia dorm gathered to watch, and we all had a great time playing together. Energized by the day's
                    activities, we then decided to buy tickets for the ESN party, the biggest event for Erasmus students
                    in Stockholm, which takes place sometime in September. <br> <br>
                    Afterward, we returned to our dorm where my Party Woop Woop friend group, now including Fynn, got
                    together to plan a trip to Göteborg. We're excited to visit the city this coming Saturday. Of
                    course, we had to end the day with another great party at KB, keeping the spirits high and the fun
                    going.

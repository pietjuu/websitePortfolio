                <h2>Erasmus week 2 - day 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, August 28, 2023, marked my first official school day. Having missed the introduction week due
                    to exams back in Belgium, I had some catching up to do, starting with setting up my school account.
                    Interestingly, unlike in Belgium, the office package isn't provided here. The setup was trickier
                    than expected since everything was in Swedish, which we couldn't fully understand. However, this
                    challenge turned out to be a blessing in disguise as it helped me meet new people who were also
                    struggling with their accounts. <br> <br>

                    Once my account was set up, I joined some folks from Perenius, my dorm, and we headed to the student
                    kick-off. The event was a bit chaotic since we were choosing individual subjects instead of
                    enrolling in a complete course, which left us without a specific group. Despite this, we made the
                    most of it, playing games like Mario Kart on the Wii and Just Dance on campus. <br> <br>

                    Later, we returned to our dorm to get ready for a big party night at KB, a popular student hangout.
                    At the party, I met people from Xenia, another student dorm. I got to know Maud, Kim, and Niels from
                    the Netherlands, who quickly became good friends. I also met Noah and David from Germany and Malta,
                    respectively, and they too became close friends. That wraps up the day!

                    What is Lorem Ipsum?

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                    Why do we use it? <br> <br>

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like). <br> <br>

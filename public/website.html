                    As part of our Professional Networking course, our assignment involved the creation of a personal
                    website using different platforms like Wix or WordPress. The website was meant to serve as a digital
                    portfolio, showcasing not only personal information but also a detailed display of various projects.
                    Additionally, it required a blog section to narrate experiences, and I took the initiative to
                    include an Erasmus blog to share my enriching journey during that time abroad. <br> <br>

                    Throughout this fulfilling project, I revisited the fundamental building blocks of HTML, focusing on
                    elements such as classes, divs, and semantic tags essential for organizing and presenting web
                    content effectively. This revisitation allowed me to structure the website systematically, ensuring
                    a coherent and understandable layout. Concurrently, I delved into the basics of CSS, aiming to
                    impart a visually appealing design to the website, making it engaging and attractive to visitors. <br> <br>

                    In a creative endeavor, I delved into JavaScript to introduce an element of interactivity. This
                    involved crafting a small yet engaging animation, adding a touch of dynamism to the site and
                    enhancing the overall user experience. <br> <br>

                    When it came to hosting the website, I opted for Google Firebase, primarily due to its cost-free
                    hosting services. This decision offered an educational opportunity, as I learned to navigate Google
                    Firebase's web hosting capabilities through the Command Line Interface (CLI), gaining valuable
                    insights into web deployment and management. <br> <br>

                    In summary, this project served not just as a task but as an enriching learning journey. It allowed
                    me to refresh my understanding of web development basics and introduced me to advanced hosting
                    solutions, broadening my skill set in the realm of web creation and management. <br> <br>

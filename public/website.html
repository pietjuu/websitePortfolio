                    As part of our Professional Networking course, our assignment involved the creation of a personal
                    website. The website was meant to serve as a digital
                    portfolio, showcasing not only personal information but also a detailed display of various projects.
                    Additionally, it required a blog section about events that we attended, and I took the initiative to
                    include an Erasmus blog to share my journey during that time abroad. <br> <br>

                    Throughout this fulfilling project, I revisited the fundamental building blocks of HTML, focusing on
                    elements such as classes, divs, and semantic tags essential for organizing and presenting web
                    content effectively. This allowed me to structure the website systematically, ensuring
                    a coherent and understandable layout. Also, I delved into the basics of CSS, aiming to
                    make a visually appealing design to the website, making it attractive to visitors. <br> <br>

                    I also delved into JavaScript to introduce an element of interactivity. This
                    involved crafting a small yet engaging animation, adding a touch of dynamism to the site and just
                    making it more fun. <br> <br>

                    When it came to hosting the website, I opted for Google Firebase, primarily due to its cost-free
                    hosting services. This decision offered an educational opportunity, as I learned to navigate Google
                    Firebase's web hosting capabilities through the Command Line Interface (CLI), gaining valuable
                    insights into web deployment and management. <br> <br>

                    In summary, this project served not just as a task but as an enriching learning journey. It allowed
                    me to refresh my understanding of web development basics and introduced me to advanced hosting
                    solutions, broadening my skill set in the realm of web creation and management. <br> <br>

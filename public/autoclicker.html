                    This idea arose while I was browsing YouTube and came across a YouTuber named Code Bullet. He made a
                    video breaking challenges on the website humanbenchmark.com. Intrigued, I wondered how difficult it would
                    be to solve (almost) every challenge. It turned out to be more challenging than I initially thought, but I
                    managed to solve almost everything. <br> <br>
                    During this project, I delved into learning new libraries such as Keyboard, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, and NumPy.
                    Some of these libraries presented significant challenges, but I successfully learned and can now use them
                    proficiently. <br> <br>
                    The project includes various files, all organized within a directory. The "Helpscripts" directory currently
                    contains three scripts: auto_clicker_fun.py, check_mouse_position.py, and draw_rectangle.py. As the names
                    suggest, these scripts were created to assist me. auto_clicker_fun.py was designed to learn how to automate
                    clicks (note that this project can be risky since it doesn't have a stop mechanism). check_mouse_position.py
                    prints the coordinates of your mouse position in the terminal, and draw_rectangle.py takes a screenshot and
                    draws a rectangle on specified coordinates. <br> <br>
                    Additionally, there is a directory named "humanbenchmark" that contains all the scripts that add an element
                    of fun to the project. These scripts open humanbenchmark and solve various challenges. By using these
                    scripts, you can find yourself among the top 0.1% of individuals worldwide who have attempted these
                    challenges. <br> <br>
                    For a more detailed explanation, you can refer to the README.md <a href="https://github.com/pietjuu/autoclicker"

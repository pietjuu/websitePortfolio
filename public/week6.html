                    The first 4 days of the week were not that busy. We needed to recover from the Stockholm trip and
                    catch up on some schoolwork.
                    We did go to the gym and had some nice dinners with friends.

                    Today was also a quiet day. We did a long run from 19km and then chilled at home. We watched a movie
                    and
                    had a nice dinner. We also did some schoolwork.

                    Today we decided to do a BBQ in Billingen. We went to the store to buy some meat and drinks. We also
                    bought some snacks. We went to Billingen by bike and found a nice spot to do the
                    BBQ, in Billingen are a lot of free BBQ provides which is nice. We had a great time and the food was
                    delicious. After the BBQ we went back home and watched a
                    movie.

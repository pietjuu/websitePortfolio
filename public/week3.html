                <p>
                    Today, September 4, was a quiet day. After a week filled with parties, everyone was feeling pretty
                    worn out. I spent the day playing basketball with the Spanish students and socializing with the
                    students from Xenia. On the picture you can even see me dunk! It was a nice, chill day to recharge
                    and enjoy some simple, fun activities.

                    Today was another laid-back day. I spent it relaxing in the common area with my fellow students,
                    just unwinding and enjoying each other's company. Nothing major happened; we simply played card
                    games and other games together. It was a nice, quiet day to just be together and have fun.

                    Today marked a slight change in my routine; finding sports activities was becoming challenging, so I
                    decided to buy a gym subscription. This way, I can keep fit and stay active. Later, all the Erasmus
                    students and I went bowling, which turned out to be a very fun experience! Noah and I teamed up,
                    humorously naming our duo “Team Small PP.” We shared a lot of laughs, struck six strikes, and even
                    made a playful challenge to do pushups whenever we missed a throw. <br> <br>

                    After bowling, I joined Maud, Niels, and some other students from Perenius to watch the first
                    "Avengers" movie from Marvel. It was a great way to relax and unwind. We also took some time to plan
                    our upcoming trip to Silverfallet! The day was full of good spirits and camaraderie, setting a
                    positive tone for the upcoming adventures.

                    What is Lorem Ipsum?

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                    Why do we use it? <br> <br>

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like). <br> <br>

                    Today, September 4, was a quiet day. After a week filled with parties, everyone was feeling pretty
                    worn out. I spent the day playing basketball with the Spanish students and socializing with the
                    students from Xenia. On the picture you can even see me dunk! It was a nice, chill day to recharge
                    and enjoy some simple, fun activities.

                    Today was another laid-back day. I spent it relaxing in the common area with my fellow students,
                    just unwinding and enjoying each other's company. Nothing major happened; we simply played card
                    games and other games together. It was a nice, quiet day to just be together and have fun.

                    Today marked a slight change in my routine; finding sports activities was becoming challenging, so I
                    decided to buy a gym subscription. This way, I can keep fit and stay active. Later, all the Erasmus
                    students and I went bowling, which turned out to be a very fun experience! Noah and I teamed up,
                    humorously naming our duo “Team Small PP.” We shared a lot of laughs, struck six strikes, and even
                    made a playful challenge to do pushups whenever we missed a throw. <br> <br>

                    After bowling, I joined Maud, Niels, and some other students from Perenius to watch the first
                    "Avengers" movie from Marvel. It was a great way to relax and unwind. We also took some time to plan
                    our upcoming trip to Silverfallet! The day was full of good spirits and camaraderie, setting a
                    positive tone for the upcoming adventures.

                    Today, after getting enough rest, I felt energized and decided to go for a run. I tackled the purple
                    track, known for being the most challenging with its numerous mountains and steep climbs. I managed
                    to complete 12 km but was too tired to run the final 2 km back home from Billingen. However, the
                    landscape during the run was truly spectacular. One of the views I captured in a photo was
                    particularly stunning. <br> <br>

                    In the evening, we gathered to watch Ireland face France in the Europe Cup Rugby. Rugby is a major
                    sport in both countries, and with many French students and a few from Ireland here, the game was a
                    big event. The match ended with a victory for France. It was a great way to wrap up an active and
                    enjoyable day.

                    Yesterday, after watching the rugby game, we were all quite worn out, so a long sleep was in order.
                    Today, however, was a big day for me. I finally received the scores from the exams I took in
                    Belgium.
                    Thankfully, I passed every course! To celebrate this great news, we decided to spend the day at the
                    lake. I was joined by Noah, Tim, Maud, Niels, David, Matthew, Mathis, Kim, Isha, Lara, and Dion—all
                    very good friends. We had a relaxing time, playing volleyball and swimming. <br> <br>

                    However, some of us left early because we didn't want to miss the World Cup basketball semi-final
                    between the USA and Germany. Everyone except Aaron was rooting for Germany, and to our surprise,
                    Germany pulled off an upset against Team USA. After the thrilling game, we headed to KB to continue
                    the celebrations for Frank’s birthday. That wrapped up the day!

                    Today was the day we finally made our trip to Silverfallet, a beautiful natural reserve known for
                    its stunning nature and a waterfall. The group included Kim, Maud, Niels, Tara, Matthew,
                    Mathis, Adam, and myself. It turned out to be a fantastic full-day adventure. We hiked through the
                    nature, climbed some mountains, and enjoyed relaxing together. <br> <br>

                    On our way back, we stopped at a small hut that displayed various old artifacts like cups and more.
                    There was also a guest book available, and of course, we took the opportunity to leave our mark by
                    writing something in it. <br> <br>

                    Afterward, we stopped at a small café to grab some drinks and food, refueling after our long day
                    outdoors. Once we got back home, we planned to have dinner together in the evening. That perfectly
                    capped off the day.

                    After our wonderful outing to Silverfallet, we met up again today to reminisce about the previous
                    day. It was a joyful gathering as everyone shared their pictures, laughter and fun stories
                    from our adventure. Following our trip down memory lane, we planned out the rest of our day. <br>
                    <br>

                    Adam, Matthew, and I watched the final of the World Cup basketball. The excitement from the game
                    carried over into the evening when the whole Silverfallet group got back together to watch the
                    Marvel movie "Endgame." It was a fitting end to a week filled with both thrilling and chill moments,
                    perfectly encapsulating our shared experiences and the fun we had together.

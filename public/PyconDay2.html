                            This session explored the development of modern search applications using a combination of
                            OpenSearch, Python, and serverless technologies. The integration of DynamoDB with OpenSearch
                            using AWS Lambda was covered, alongside the role of Elasticsearch within this ecosystem. The
                            session addressed several challenges, including the need for multilingual support, fuzzy
                            searching, autocomplete features, and dynamic data mapping. Techniques like prefix matching,
                            completion suggestions, and real-time search were also discussed to enhance search
                            efficiency.

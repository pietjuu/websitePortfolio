                    Taking on a school project focused on network and system pentesting for OfficeHustler was an
                    interesting dive into the world of cybersecurity. The main goal was to check and strengthen their
                    digital defenses. Each part of this project looked into different aspects of their network security.
                    In this project we learned a lot of different techniques and tools to pentest a network such as
                    nmap, metasploit, mimikatz, and many more. We also learned how to write a pentest report and what are
                    the best practices are.
                    <br> <br>

                    Starting with online research (chapter 1), the aim was to understand OfficeHustler's online presence
                    and find areas that might be at risk. This set the stage for the network scanning phase (chapter 3),
                    where a detailed look aimed to find weaknesses in their network. <br> <br>

                    The hands-on part of the project unfolded in chapters 4â€“10. This involved trying to access machines,
                    testing different protocols, and eventually gaining access to the domain controller, a crucial step
                    in the evaluation. Specific details of these steps are not shared to keep things confidential. <br>
                    <br>

                    The recommendations in the final assessment are made to fit OfficeHustler's unique situation. These
                    suggestions tackle found issues and suggest ways to make their security stronger. This mix of
                    academic knowledge and hands-on practice not only helps me understand network and system pentesting
                    better but also contributes to making OfficeHustler more secure in the online world. <br> <br>

                <p>
                    The first four days of this week are very quiet. We did not have any trips planned and we had a lot
                    of time to catch up on schoolwork. We did go to the gym a few times and had some nice dinners with
                    friends.

                    Today I traveled to Göthenburg to prepare for the marathon that is tomorrow. Unfortunately, the
                    train had a lot of delays and I arrived late. I had to hurry to the hotel to get some rest. I went
                    to bed early to get some
                    rest for the marathon.

                    Today was the moment we have all been waiting for. The marathon in Göthenburg. I was very nervous
                    and I woke up early to get some breakfast. I went to the starting point and I was ready to run. The
                    marathon was very hard and I was very tired. I did not finish the marathon, but I am happy that I
                    tried. I will try again next year. I did run 24 km.

                    today was rest day. I was still very tired from the marathon, and I decided to stay in bed all day.

                <h2>Erasmus week 14 - day 1 and 2</h2>
                <p>
                    the first 2 days were chill days, we went to the gym and had some nice dinners with friends. The
                    cool thing was that we finally saw our first snow in Sweden. It was a pretty stunning view to wake
                    up and see everything in the snow.

                    Today was highlighted with a trip to the ice hockey game. It was a great experience and we had a lot

                    It is interesting to see that they fight a lot and it was very spectacular to see.

                    Today we went to Göthenburg to watch a women football game. It was a championsleague matchup against

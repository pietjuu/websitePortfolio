                <p>
                    These 3 weeks were very relaxing. We did not have any trips planned and we had a lot of time to
                    catch up on schoolwork. We did go to the gym a few times and had some nice dinners with friends.
                    During the week we watched a lot of movies. It was just normal weeks with a lot of schoolwork.

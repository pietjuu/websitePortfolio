                    <p>
                        Howest recently hosted an event featuring Niels Desloovere, who shared his expertise on critical
                        cybersecurity topics. The event emphasized the importance of threat intelligence in protecting
                        against evolving cyber threats.

                        Desloovere highlighted the efforts of Cyber Crime Belgium (CCB) in combating cybercrime and
                        fostering collaboration between public and private sectors. He also discussed the MITRE ATT&CK
                        framework, explaining its role in understanding and defending against adversary tactics and
                        techniques.

                        A key part of the event was a live demonstration of MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform &
                        Threat Sharing). Desloovere showed how MISP helps organizations share structured threat
                        information to enhance detection, analysis, and response capabilities.

                        The session concluded with an engaging Q&A, providing attendees with practical insights and
                        reinforcing the importance of continuous learning and collaboration in cybersecurity.

                        Howest's event was a valuable opportunity for participants to stay updated on the latest trends
                        and tools in the field, underscoring the critical role of threat intelligence and information
                        sharing.

                <p>
                    A part of the second year of System and Network Administration involves carrying out a practical
                    project at our internship site. I conducted my project at the company EFFIX, and it was focused on
                    security, which is personally the most interesting aspect of IT for me. Due to my interest in this
                    field, I plan to continue my studies next year in applied computer science, specializing in
                    cybersecurity. Securing data and making it challenging for hackers is something I am eager to delve
                    into. <br> <br>

                    The project at EFFIX revolved around security, a topic I have been interested in for a long time. My
                    fascination began when I had the opportunity to set up a firewall for the first time. This
                    experience revealed to me the vast amount of work in this sector of IT and the depth of this
                    subject. I am eager to further explore this area, and this project has already provided me with
                    significant insights. <br> <br>

                    I found this assignment to be very positive. Conducting a project independently has been a
                    tremendous learning experience for me. I had to significantly expand my knowledge of security to
                    successfully complete this project. <br> <br>

                    Working at EFFIX was always enjoyable. There was something new to do every day, contributing to my
                    continuous learning. Every colleague was ready to assist us and present new challenges. I had the
                    opportunity to experience various aspects of IT, such as working on the helpdesk, accompanying
                    colleagues to set up networks at client locations, performing minor interventions independently, and
                    handling small tasks in the office. <br> <br>

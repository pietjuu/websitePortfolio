                            The first day only started in the afternoon, so I had some time to explore the city. I went
                            to Milan city were I visited the famous church Duomo di Milano. The church is the largest in
                            Italy and the third largest in the world. The church is located in the city center and is a
                            must-see when you are in Milan. The church is made of white marble and has a lot of statues
                            on the outside. The inside of the church is also very beautiful with a lot of paintings and
                            sculptures. After visiting the church I went to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. This is a
                            shopping mall with a lot of luxury shops. The shopping mall is located next to the church
                            and is also a must-see when you are in Milan. The shopping mall is very beautiful with a lot
                            of glass and iron. After visiting the shopping mall I went to the Sforza Castle. This is a
                            castle that was built in the 15th century and is now a museum. The castle is located in a
                            park and is also a must-see when you are in Milan. The castle is very beautiful with a lot
                            of towers and walls. After visiting the castle I went back to the hotel to get ready for the
                            conference.

                                After the visit to the city, I went to the conference. The conference started with a
                                welcome session for first time attendees. In this session, the organizers of the
                                conference welcomed all the first time attendees and gave them some information about
                                the conference. They also gave some tips on how to get the most out of the conference.
                                After this session we got served a welcome drink and some snacks. This was a great way
                                to start the conference and to meet some new people.

                            Day 2 of the conference started with a keynote speech by the CEO of Common Europe. He talked
                            about the evolution of the organization and the challenges that lie ahead. After the keynote
                            speech, there were several breakout sessions on different topics.

                                I attended a lot of sessions but I decided to write about the most interesting one. The
                                session was about the CIS controls in IBMI. The speaker talked about the importance of
                                the CIS controls and how they can help organizations to improve their security posture.
                                He also talked about the different controls that are included in the CIS controls and
                                how organizations can implement them. The session was very informative and I learned a
                                lot from it.

                                After the sessions, there was a dinner with the Belgium delegation. The dinner was held
                                in a restaurant in the city center and was very nice. We had a three-course meal with
                                a lot of wine. The food was very good and the company was even better. We had a lot
                                of fun and talked about a lot of different topics. It was a great way to end the day and
                                to get to know some new people.

                            Day 3 started with some early morning sessions. It was funny to see that the attendance was
                            lower than the first sessions.

                                Day 3 was only half a day, so after the last session, there was a roundup of the
                                conference.
                                The organizers thanked all the attendees and the sponsors for making the conference a
                                success.
                                I personally had a great time and learned a lot from the conference. I met a lot of new
                                people and got some new insights into the world of cybersecurity. I am already looking
                                forward to next year's conference.
                                After the roundup, I went back to the city to do some more sightseeing before heading
                                back home.

                <p>
                    This was one of the most relaxing weeks so far. We did not have any trips planned and we had a lot
                    of time to catch up on schoolwork. We did go to the gym a few times and had some nice dinners with
                    friends. We also went to the store to buy some meat and drinks for a BBQ in Billingen. We had a
                    great time and the food was delicious. After the BBQ we went back home and watched a movie. We also
                    did some schoolwork and prepared for the next week.

                <p>
                    The first 2 days are more or less chill days. We did not have anything planned and decided to join
                    the local volleyball and basketball team. We had a lot of fun and we are planning to join them more
                    often.

                    Today was a very important day. I had all my exams on this day. I was very nervous and I studied a
                    lot.
                    lucky for me everything was going well and I passed all my exams.

                    Because everybody was done with the exams we decided to go to the local small swimming pool. We had
                    a lot of fun and we are planning to go more often. We did all the slides, played some games, went to
                    the bubble bath and had a lot of fun.

                <p>
                    Today we went costume shopping because halloween is close and we had a halloween party planned. We
                    had a lot of fun and we are looking forward to the party.
                    I dressed up as Spiderbar and Matthew dressed up as Partyman. It was a fun way to change the
                    avengers characters.

                    Today was the day of the halloween party. We had a lot of fun and we are planning to do this more
                    often. We had a lot of drinks, played some games and danced a lot. It was a fun night.

                    Today was a rest day. We were all very tired from the party and we decided to stay in bed all day.
